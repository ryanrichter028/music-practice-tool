How time signatures work:

3/2 = 3 half notes
3/4 = 3 quarter notes
5/8 = 5 eighth notes

Notes defined by reciprocal 

numerator = number of beats in a measure

denominator = note value of the beat
2: half note per beat (2 per measure)
4: quarter note

Play a beat (percussive sound)
Set tempo (BPM)
